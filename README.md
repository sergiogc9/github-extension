## Features

This extensions adds a **sidebar** at left of the page in code and pull requests Github pages. It shows the repository tree with some nice search and filter features.

It also adds a **popup** visible when clicking the extension icon in which you can see all you Github pull requests you are somehow related, (e.g. you created it, you are a reviewer, you commented it, etc.).

üåûüåö Supports all **light** and **dark** Github modes!

#### Sidebar

If you are in a page **repository source page**:

- List repository tree.
- Search and filter by file name.
- Detect the branch showing the files in that branch.
- Possibility to lazy load sub directories, useful for big repositories.
- Go to file when clicking on it.

If you are in a **pull request page**:

- List the files changed in the PR.
- Search and filter by file name.
- Show some data about the PR, e.g. number of commits, comments, files added and removed, etc.
- Show if a file is added or removed.
- Show people who commented.
- Show information about checks passed or not.
- Possibility to approve or reject changes.
- Possibility to merge the PR.

‚ö†Ô∏è The merge button is only enabled following some conditions that I set up for my convenience. It's enabled when there is at least 1 approval, all checks are green, there are no conflicts and you have permissions to merge the PR.

In **settings page** (clicking the bottom right cog):

- Enter the Github token. It is only saved locally.
- Hide / show sidebar when being in a Github page not implemented.
- Group or not empty folders to reduce the tree size.
- Lazy load or not sub directories. If enabled, only the root directory is fetched and every sub directory is fetched when opened, otherwise the whole repository tree is fetched at the beginning.

#### Popup

Shows information about to all PR that you are somehow related:

- List all pull requests.
- Show changes since you last visited the PR, e.g. new comments, commits, etc.
- Show checks status.
- Possibility to star and hide pull requests.
